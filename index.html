    <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto text-center">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">About Me</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-6">
        I graduated with a Computer Science degree from UTRGV in 2022 and I am currently a fledgling software developer in Harlingen, TX. 
        My years in school opened an interest in software that extends well beyond my professional life! You'll often find me 
        diving into side projects in my free time. Usually trying to build something that mixes my love of software and music. My biggest 
        strength is my relentless attention to detail—whether it’s fine-tuning a user interface or optimizing a workflow, I focus on 
        delivering the best possible experience for users. Technically, I’m most comfortable in the world of application development. 
        Web apps, mobile apps, desktop apps, and their associated backend/databse components are where my interests deeply align. In terms of tools and frameworks: Angular, Express backends, .NET backends, 
        NodeJS, and MySQL are some of my most familiar techonologies, and recently I've been playing inside Apple's ecosystem with XCode and Swift, 
        but I never hesitate to jump into any task with whatever tool the sitation calls for. Our industry's unprecendented
        turn into AI-assisted workflows has made picking up new skill sets very enjoyable
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-6">
        A little bit about my programming philosophy: I believe that software
        should be, at its core, a loyal extension of the user's will. I believe in programming for the end user.  
        I believe the number 1 skill for a developer to possess is empathy. The ability to put oneself in the shoes of another and act in a way that is beneficial for all. 
        I'm very big on building user-centric software because, in the end, user experience is king! Any output of mine will be deeply rooted in this philosophy, so you can trust 
        that you'll have an earnest young man trying his hardest to understand your users and trying his hardest to make them go "Oh, wow, this software feels really good!"
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        Outside of coding, I enjoy listening to music—so much that I built Rarelygroovy.com to catalog my area's local artists and make discovering new bands 
        a delight. I love diving into album art, reading about how bands formed, and connecting the dots between different projects. 
        Ultimately, whether I’m exploring music or writing code, I’m driven by the same goal: crafting experiences people genuinely enjoy.
